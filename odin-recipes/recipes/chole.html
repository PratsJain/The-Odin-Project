    <h1>Chole Bhature</h1>
    <img src="images/chole.jpg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chole bhature, also known as 'channa bhatura' is a North-Indian must-have. A combination of two dishes—chole, 
        which is a spicy chickpea curry, and bhature, a type of fried bread made with maida—it makes for a meal that's 
        just right for Sunday afternoons, and should ideally be followed by a post-lunch snooze.</p>
